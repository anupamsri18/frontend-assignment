## Important Points to Note

- Your code has to be fully responsive & should work on all the devices (including mobile).
- We are really, really interested in your object oriented development skills, so please solve the problem keeping this in mind. Also handle the edge cases (if any).
- Your codebase should have the same level of structure and organised as any mature open source project including coding conventions, directory structure, INSTRUCTIONS.md with clear instructions and additionally a runner shell script that automates the entire build and execute process.
- You need to use Git for version control. 
- Frequent commits are a huge plus.
- Do not check in vendor libraries or output from the build process. Use a standard build automation & dependency system like go modules/npm.
- Do not make your solution or this problem publicly available by, for example, using GitHub or Bitbucket or by posting this problem to a blog or forum.
